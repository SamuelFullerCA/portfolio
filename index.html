                <P class="bio">Born and raised on the northern island of New Zealand, I moved to Souther California at the age of 10
                    I grew up facinated by both the utility and hardware of computers as wel as the digital world. I was always
                    facinated by how I could connnect to a a hole new digital world and even connect to my favult thousands of 
                    miles across the pacific. 
                    <br><br>
                    Out of highschool I followed in my fathers footsteps and entered the Audio-Visual world. I worked as an A/V 
                    technician for 3 years before realizing I always found myself more interested in the digital engineerig adn processing
                    of audio moire than i enjoyed the physical labor of installing it as a technician. This let me to reinvest
                    back into my passion of the digital word
                    <br><br>
                    So here I am as an skilled full-stack web developer finiding passion in developing, fixing, and exploring
                    web applications as if they were the blah blah blah </p>
