                <!-- bio can be easily edited in the future to better express myself and what I can do -->
                <P id="bio">Born and raised on the northern island of New Zealand, I moved to Southern California at the age of 10,
                    I grew up facinated by both the utility and hardware of computers, as well as the digital world. I was always
                    facinated by how I could enter a whole new digital world and virtually be able to connect with my family thousands of 
                    miles across the Pacific. 
                    <br><br>
                    Out of highschool I followed in my fathers footsteps and entered the Audio-Visual world. I worked as an A/V 
                    technician for 3 years before realizing I always found myself more interested in the digital engineerig and processing
                    of audio moire than I enjoyed the physical labor of installing it as a technician. This led me to reinvest
                    back into my passion of the digital word.
                    <br><br>
                    <!-- remove "soon to be" after bootcamp :))) -->
                    So here I am as an (soon to be) skilled full-stack  web developer finiding passion in developing, fixing, and exploring
                    web applications. My journey to reach this point, where I'm happy and passionate with what I do, has been a long one 
                    and I'm looking forward to adding my mark to the every growing and evolving digital universe.
